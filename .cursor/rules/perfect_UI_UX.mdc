# ü™Ñ Perfect UI/UX Design Rules

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- **Every element must serve a clear purpose**
- Remove anything that doesn't improve user understanding
- Use familiar patterns unless innovation provides clear value

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- **Establish clear importance levels** (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Use size, color, contrast, and spacing to guide attention
- Follow natural reading patterns (F/Z patterns for western audiences)

### 3. Responsive & Adaptive
- **Design for smallest screen first (mobile-first)**
- Ensure fluid transitions between breakpoints
- Consider touch targets (minimum 48x48px)

## üèÜ UX Golden Rules

### Loading States
- Always show loading indicators for actions >200ms
- Use skeleton screens for content loading
- Implement optimistic UI for actions

### Error Handling
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Maintain system state after errors
- Offer recovery paths

### Form Design
- Inline validation with positive reinforcement
- Logical tab order
- Proper labeling (never rely solely on placeholders)

### Performance
- Critical CSS in head
- Lazy load non-critical resources
- Compress images (WebP format preferred)

---

## üñºÔ∏è Visual Design Checklist
- **Contrast Ratio:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
- **Whitespace:** At least 1rem between unrelated elements
- **Consistency:** Reuse components and patterns
- **Microinteractions:** Provide feedback for user actions
- **Dark Mode:** Implement prefers-color-scheme media query

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly

### Color Usage
- Don't convey information with color alone
- Test with color blindness simulators

### Text Alternatives
- Alt text for images
- Transcripts/captions for media

## ‚ö° Framework-Specific Notes

### shadcn/ui Implementation
```tsx
// Use composition patterns
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Accessible Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Supporting text</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {/* Content */}
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter className="flex justify-between">
    <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
    <Button>Confirm</Button>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

- Use their responsive hooks
- Implement their accessibility utilities
- Use their MCP, if avaliable

- A/B test significant changes
- Document design decisions
